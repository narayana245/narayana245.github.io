    <section class="interests">
        <p>
            Ever since I was young, I've been drawn to the blend of creativity, rhythm, and movement. My interests reflect different sides of who I am — a mix of energy, focus, and expression. 
            Music, sports, martial arts, and cooking all teach me discipline and mindfulness in their own ways. Whether I'm performing, competing, or experimenting with a recipe, 
            I'm always learning something about patience, teamwork, and the joy of improving a little every day. Each passion has shaped my perspective and taught me valuable lessons 
            that extend far beyond the activity itself. Through these pursuits, I've discovered the importance of dedication, the beauty of self-expression, and the power of pushing my limits. 
            They remind me that growth happens when we step outside our comfort zones and embrace challenges with an open mind. These interests aren't just hobbies — they're fundamental parts 
            of who I am and how I navigate the world. They provide balance, inspiration, and a sense of purpose that drives me forward every single day.

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
            Singing has been a transformative part of my life for as long as I can remember. From the intricate ragas of Indian classical music to the harmonious blend of a cappella performances, 
            music allows me to express emotions that words alone cannot capture. Indian classical music, in particular, has taught me patience and discipline — mastering a raga requires hours of 
            practice, deep listening, and an understanding of both technical precision and emotional depth. A cappella singing, on the other hand, has shown me the power of collaboration and harmony. 
            Working with a group to create beautiful music without any instruments is both challenging and rewarding. It's about listening carefully, blending voices, and trusting your teammates. 
            Music has also been a source of comfort during stressful times, a way to connect with my cultural roots, and a medium through which I can share joy with others. Whether I'm performing 
            on stage or simply practicing at home, singing reminds me of the beauty in dedication and the profound connection that music creates between people.

        <h3>Basketball</h3>
        <p>
            Basketball is more than just a sport to me — it's a way of life that teaches resilience, strategy, and teamwork. Every time I step onto the court, I'm reminded of the importance of 
            communication, quick decision-making, and trusting my teammates. The fast-paced nature of the game keeps me sharp and forces me to think several moves ahead, much like a chess match in motion. 
            I love the physicality of basketball — the way it challenges both my body and mind simultaneously. Whether I'm working on perfecting my jump shot, improving my defensive stance, or learning 
            new plays, there's always room to grow and refine my skills. Playing pickup games with friends on weekends has also taught me valuable lessons about sportsmanship and camaraderie. 
            Watching NBA games has deepened my appreciation for the sport, as I study the strategies of professional players and incorporate their techniques into my own game. Basketball has helped me 
            build confidence, stay physically active, and develop a competitive spirit that motivates me in all areas of life. It's taught me that success comes from consistent effort, adaptability, 
            and the willingness to learn from both victories and defeats.

        <h3>Martial Arts</h3>
        <p>
            Martial arts has been instrumental in shaping my character and instilling values that extend far beyond physical combat. Through consistent training, I've learned the importance of 
            self-control, respect, and mental fortitude. Every session is a lesson in discipline — from perfecting forms and techniques to understanding when to apply force and when to exercise restraint. 
            Martial arts has taught me that true strength comes not from aggression, but from confidence, composure, and the ability to remain calm under pressure. The journey has been as much about 
            personal growth as it is about physical development. I've learned to set goals, track my progress, and celebrate small victories along the way. The focus required during training has also 
            improved my concentration in other areas of life, from academics to personal projects. Beyond self-defense, martial arts has given me a sense of empowerment and the confidence to face 
            challenges head-on. It's about continuous improvement, humility, and the understanding that mastery is a lifelong pursuit. The principles I've learned on the mat — discipline, perseverance, 
            and respect — guide me daily and remind me that growth requires both physical and mental commitment.
