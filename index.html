            Welcome to my website! I'm Arvind Narayan — a curious, creative, and passionate learner who loves exploring how art, movement, and technology connect. Outside of academics, you'll usually find me singing Indian classical or a cappella music, playing basketball, experimenting in the kitchen, or training in martial arts. I've always believed in balance — using physical activity, music, and mindfulness to stay grounded while pushing toward new goals.

            These interests inspire how I approach everything in life — from teamwork and discipline to creativity and focus. Whether I'm perfecting a song, learning a new jump shot, or taking on a challenging project, I enjoy the process of growth and self-improvement. This site shares a glimpse into who I am and what motivates me every day.
